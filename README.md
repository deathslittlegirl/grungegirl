# grungegirl. cli-based drug search for girls.

welcome.

`grungegirl` is a unix-based research multi-tool designed around recreational drug use and spirituality. this is the swiss army knife for those interested in drug culture. it is not built to enable users, as this application has very little choice over whether or not that person becomes a drug addict after using it.
