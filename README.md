# grungegirl
grungegirl aims to make available a massive amount of information about different drugs offline. This tool is for the hacker that just got some new shit. grungegirl is coded in python, making it extremely flexible in terms of its modularity. programmed in 48 hours under the influence of weed and espressos, i've cobbled together a very quick way to start getting more information about drugs. updates will be released in packs per category of drug. 

expect a psych update extremely soon. this one is for you, ronald reagan!
