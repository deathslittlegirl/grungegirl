# grungegirl 

welcome to elif city

grungegirl aims to make available a massive amount of information about different drugs offline. built in python for easy transportability, grungegirl makes an effort to provide a utility for getting quick information about drugs. it's terminal-based, which means you can (or need to) alias a command in order to use it. but the terminal is the fastest thing in linux, so being able to whip open information about drugs is useful.

to install it, run the `install.sh` file.

## explaining the file layout

i will get a lot of questions about the file layout. the answer is simple. i don't want my main.py crowded with all the things i plan to do for each entry. it is going to get extremely trippy and modular. i need my ducks lined up in a row. think of it as a spider's body layout, with all necessary components of the spider keeping it alive. now imagine if that spider could transform or modify each of its parts individually. upgraded poison, higher jump height. longer legs. bigger eyes. deeper stare. 


## planned updates

- Psychedelics Mass Update
- Stimulants Mass Update
- Astrology Mass Update
- Onion Link/Tor Browser Redirect, Sellers, Marketplaces, Amazon

## included functions

`web` opens the ability to search psychonaut.wiki for more information related to the available list of drugs. it uses lynx for maximum speed when handling python code. it will probably be this way for a while.
