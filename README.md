# grungegirl. cli-based drug search for girls.

welcome.

`grungegirl` is aiming to be the premier drug culture application. it is the hacker's encyclopedia for drugs, programmed by a hardcore feminist. i mention my feminism because feminism shares a lot of similar traits with drug culture. drugs and their addicts are treated unfairly, even by people who are meant to support them.

now i am making something that every drug addict could use, out of sheer rebellion. it's a swiss army knife in the drug department as it relates to the internet. i was an avid believer in the way death grips ran things. i follow the same rebellious approach when it comes to creating software. 

`grungegirl` is built to break the rules. it will monitor, make available, and maintain all resources related to drugs. this isn't to "enable drug users". it is an offline repository of information that can go online at will.

to install it, run the `install.py` file. the `install.py` file will install `lynx`, move necessities to a folder in `$HOME` and bind a command. in the future, it will also attempt to compile `browsh` from source or otherwise install it cleanly in distros where it can get away with it. this is for you, ronald reagan.

## why was this even bothered with. idiot.

like i said, drug addicts are treated very poorly throughout history. it's time to have a small win within the community, making an application that pushes the bounds. drugs can benefit from a bit of organization anyway. what's cooler than being able to understand quick info about drugs in a heartbeat without the necessity of an internet connection? this is how we party in the year 2070.

## explaining the file layout. innovative and jittery.

for now, just trust me. the spider-leg layout is an innovative decision emphasizing the modular aspect of python code and extending the capabilities of the software. it made the use of `lynx` possible through its "jumping-spider" style import installation. every line of code is implemented by hand, so it's like giving myself extra arms. it's modularity will come in handy when i give the lynx integration its final polish around 0.6.0. folders will be applied to different sections.

## planned updates. cycles for the future.

- Massive repository of drugs organized by category, class, price and legality.
- Overwhelming breadth of information related to astrology, accessible offline and fast.
- Onion Link/Tor Browser Redirect, Sellers, Marketplaces, Amazon. Editable through Python coding to launch a browser of your choice.
- Information available on how to securely use Tor and the rest of the internet.

- `crypto` command for monitoring cryptocurrency prices and managing a wallet.
- `buy` will open a list of products that you can access online in a browser of your choosing.
- `rehab` will use approximate location to find and target rehabs in your area.

## included functions. humble beginnings.

- `web` opens the ability to search psychonaut.wiki for more information related to the available list of drugs. it uses lynx for maximum speed when handling python code. it will probably be this way for a while. vaporwave helps. 

- `exit` will formally exit the application. you could also just spam ctrl + c.

- `brow.sh` integration.

## is it legal

we'll see.
