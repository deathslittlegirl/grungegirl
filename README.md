# grungegirl. cli-based drug search for girls.

welcome.

`grungegirl` is aiming to be the premier drug culture application. it is the hacker's encyclopedia for drugs, programmed by a hardcore feminist, struggling with themes of oppression in drug culture. drugs and their addicts are treated unfairly, even by people who are meant to support them. they are also viewed as lesser by society, even though many of them are smarter and better.

`grungegirl` is built to break the rules. this is the swiss army knife for those interested in drug culture. it is not built to enable users, as this application has very little choice over whether or not that person becomes a drug addict after using it.

it is instead built to level the playing field, giving people who are often ignored by society tools that help them explore and conquer the world of drugs. drugs can destroy lives, but so can everything else. we shouldn't hurt those that choose to indulge in them.

to install it, run the `install.py` file. 
the `install.py` file will install `browsh`, move necessities to a folder in `$HOME` and bind a command. 
in the future, it will also attempt to compile `browsh` from source or otherwise install it cleanly in distros where it can get away with it.

## why was this even bothered with. idiot.

like i said, drug addicts are treated very poorly throughout history. it's time to have a small win within the community, making an application that adds movement to that lifestyle. drugs can benefit from a bit of organization, anyway. there's nothing cooler to a drug addict than being able to understand quick info about drugs in a heartbeat. this is how we party in the year 2070.

## explaining the file layout. innovative and jittery.

for now, just trust me. the spider-leg layout is an innovative decision emphasizing the modular aspect of python code and extending the capabilities of the software. it made the use of `lynx` possible through its "jumping-spider" style import installation. every line of code is implemented by hand, so it's like giving myself extra arms. it's modularity will come in handy when i give the lynx integration its final polish around 0.6.0. folders will be applied to different sections.

## planned updates. cycles for the future.

- Massive repository of drugs organized by category, class, price and legality.
- Overwhelming breadth of information related to astrology, accessible offline and fast.
- Onion Link/Tor Browser Redirect, Sellers, Marketplaces, Amazon. Editable through Python coding to launch a browser of your choice.
- Information available on how to securely use Tor and the rest of the internet.

- `crypto` command for monitoring cryptocurrency prices and managing a wallet.
- `buy` will open a list of products that you can access online in a browser of your choosing.
- `rehab` will use approximate location to find and target rehabs in your area.
- `reports` will display trip reports based on whatever drug you request to hear them about.

## included functions. humble beginnings.

- `web` opens the ability to search psychonaut.wiki for more information related to the available list of drugs. it uses `browsh` for speed and extensibility. it will probably be this way for a while. vaporwave helps. 

- `exit` will formally exit the application. you could also just spam ctrl + c.

- `brow.sh` integration.

## is it legal

we'll see.
