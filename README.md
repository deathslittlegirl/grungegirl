# grungegirl
grungegirl aims to make available a massive amount of information about different drugs offline. built in python for easy transportability, grungegirl makes an effort to provide a utility for getting quick information about drugs. it's terminal-based, which means you can (or need to) alias a command in order to use it. but the terminal is the fastest thing in linux, so being able to whip open information about drugs is useful.

planned updates include: marketplaces, popular sellers of each drug, psychedelics, dissos, stims, depressants.

to install it, run the `install.sh` file, then copy and paste the following to `~/.bashrc`: `alias grungegirl='python main.py'`
