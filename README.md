# grungegirl. cli-based drug search for girls.

welcome.

`grungegirl` is aiming to be the premier drug culture application. it is the hacker's drug encyclopedia, programmed by a hardcore feminist. it follows the unix philosophy, so expect great things related to drugs. it aims to be undyingly faithful to python, but will see some rust integration for speed. i was an avid believer in the way death grips ran things. so now i follow the same approach when it comes to often tiring aspects of self-undoing. transformation in 12th house astrology is somewhat of a forbidden practice. 

but `grungegirl` is built to break the rules and complete my destiny. to install it, run the `install.py` file. the `install.py` file will install `browsh`. it will then move necessities to a folder in `$HOME` and bind a `python` command to the command `grungegirl`. in the case of `browsh` not being installed, the script spits out a warning.

to install it, run the `install.py` file. the `install.py` will install `lynx`, move necessities to a folder in `$HOME` and bind a command. in the future, it will also attempt to compile `browsh` from source or otherwise install it cleanly in distros where it can get away with it. this is for you, ronald reagan.

## why was this even bothered with. idiot.

in the twelfth house of astrology there is an affinity to dream. this app exists to keep dreamers alive. when drugs combine with the unix philosophy, you get something incredibly powerful that helps drugs stay in motion while providing ample resources for harm redux. when this began, i was programming the software to be used by someone under the influence of any drug. as long as they could spell and read, they could launch the application and use it. it is the drug-loving hacker's ultimate tool.

drugs can benefit from a bit of organization anyway. what's cooler than being able to understand quick info about drugs in a heartbeat without the necessity of an internet connection? i've taken the fine wine approach to building something important. once extreme changes are being made more frequently, it will become the ultimate hippie application, with agency in the most necessary scenarios. this is how we party in the year 2070.

## explaining the file layout. innovative and jittery.

for now, just trust me. the spider-leg layout is an innovative decision emphasizing the modular aspect of python code and extending the capabilities of the software. it made the use of `lynx` possible through its "jumping-spider" style import installation. every line of code is implemented by hand, so it's like giving myself extra arms. it's modularity will come in handy when i give the lynx integration its final polish around 0.6.0. folders will be applied to different sections.

## planned updates. cycles for the future.

- Massive repository of drugs organized by category, class, price and legality.
- Overwhelming breadth of information related to astrology, accessible offline and fast.
- Onion Link/Tor Browser Redirect, Sellers, Marketplaces, Amazon. Editable through Python coding to launch a browser of your choice.

- `crypto` command for monitoring, selling and wallet.
- `buy` will open a list of products that you can access online in a browser of your choosing.
- `rehab` will use approximate location to find and target rehabs in your area.

## included functions. humble beginnings.

- `web` opens the ability to search psychonaut.wiki for more information related to the available list of drugs. it uses lynx for maximum speed when handling python code. it will probably be this way for a while. vaporwave helps. 

- `exit` will formally exit the application. you could also just spam ctrl + c.

- `brow.sh` integration.

## is it legal

yes. this application is designed for research. it's supposed to promote harm reduction and education on the subject of drugs.
