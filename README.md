grungegirl is currently undergoing a beautification process. the file quantity is unnecessary, alongside several other problems with the installation process. and some distros straight up bork, requiring a more generalized function to install. if it does not work for you at this time, that is my fault alone unless it is something that you know is your fault.

# grungegirl. cli-based drug search for girls.

welcome.

`grungegirl` is a unix-based research multi-tool designed around recreational drug use and spirituality. this is the swiss army knife for those interested in drug culture. it is not built to enable users, as this application has very little choice over whether or not that person becomes a drug addict after using it.

## Installation

Windows users will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux alongside a compatible distro to be able to use this. Ubuntu is recommended. 

1. git clone this directory or download the provided package. 
2. `cd grungegirl/`
3. `python install.py`
4. `grungegirl`

This strategy currently works on Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and Void Linux. 

You may have to run `. ~/.bashrc` after the installation to be sure that the `grungegirl` command works. (I KNOW NOW THAT YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THIS IM CHANGING IT LOL)
