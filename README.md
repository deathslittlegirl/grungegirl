# grungegirl 

welcome.

`grungegirl` is aiming to be the premier drug culture application. it is the hacker's drug encyclopedia. it follows the unix philosophy, so expect great things related to drugs. it aims to be undyingly faithful to python, but will see some rust integration for speed. i was an avid believer in the way death grips ran things. so now i follow the same approach when it comes to often tiring aspects of self-undoing. transformation in 12th house astrology is somewhat of a forbidden practice. 

but `grungegirl` is built to break the rules and complete my destiny. to install it, run the `install.py` file. the `install.py` file will install `lynx`, move necessities to a folder in `$HOME` and bind a `python` command to the command `grungegirl`.

## explaining the file layout

the spider-leg layout is an innovative decision emphasizing the modular aspect of python code and extending the capabilities of the software. it made the use of `lynx` possible through its "jumping-spider" style import installation. every line of code is implemented by hand, so it's like giving myself extra arms. it's modularity will come in handy when i give the lynx integration its final polish around 0.6.0. folders will be applied to different sections. 


## planned updates

- Massive repository of drugs organized by category, class, price and legality.
- Overwhelming breadth of information related to astrology, accessible offline and fast.
- Onion Link/Tor Browser Redirect, Sellers, Marketplaces, Amazon. Editable through Python coding to launch a browser of your choice.
- brow.sh integration. 
- `crypto` command for monitoring, selling and wallet.
- `buy` will open a list of products that you can access online in a browser of your choosing.

## included functions

`web` opens the ability to search psychonaut.wiki for more information related to the available list of drugs. it uses lynx for maximum speed when handling python code. it will probably be this way for a while. vaporwave helps. 

`exit` will formally exit the application. you could also just spam ctrl + c.
