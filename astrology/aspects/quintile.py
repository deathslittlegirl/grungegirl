    print('''The quintile points to talents and potential not necessarily indicated by the major aspects. This is particulary true of artistic talent. In comparison to trines, quintiles give a greater emphasis on the purposeful manifestation of one's talents, or making something of them; be they artistic, scientific, or demonstrations of one's personal power. Thus quintiles appear with some frequency in the charts of both artists and repressive political leaders. In each case they suggest talent plus the ambition to make something of it in the world. 
    
As aspect of 72 degrees between two planets, with the biquintile separated by 144 degrees. The quintile is considered to be a minor aspect and although it is thought to be a favourable one it is seldom used for interpretation purposes. It is valid with an orb of 2 to 3 degrees.   ''')
