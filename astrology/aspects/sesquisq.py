    print('''The sesquiquadrate's energy is similar to that of the square and semi-square. It belongs to the group of analytical aspects divisible by 2, which create tension and challenge us to work and learn. But the conflict is less apparent than with the square. It is easier to supress, making it more difficult to learn from the challenge. Sesquiquadrates tend to indicate a smouldering conflict that one would prefer to ignore. Any relief would then tend to be short-lived. Sesquiquadrates therefore tend to indicate themes of a long-term and stubborn nature.
    
An aspect in which two planets are separated by an angle of 135 degrees. The sesquisquare (or sesquiquadrate) is regarded as a minor aspect. It can be calculated with an orb of 2 to 3 degrees.''')
