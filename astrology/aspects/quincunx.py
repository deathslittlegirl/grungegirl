    print('''A quincunx can involve an effort to reconcile two planets' meanings in the chart, but even when the initial signs seem positive, there is no guarantee of success. In the end, it may not prove possible to truly integrate the energies involved. These patterns of tension that are relatively minor, yet persistent and difficult to resolve lead to this aspect's second meaning: adjustment. 
    
It is often simply easier to live with a source of disappointment or aggravation than to take action to try to resolve it. Perhaps the person feels the present outcome is inevitable. 

An aspect of 150 degrees between two planets. The quincunx is thought to be one of the most important minor aspects. It is valid with an orb of up to three degrees. Even astrologers who do not usually work with minor aspects often include quincunx aspects in their interpretations.''')
