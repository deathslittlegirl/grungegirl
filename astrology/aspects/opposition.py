    print('''The opposition is an aspect of tension and is considered to be the second most powerful aspect after the conjunction. The planets involved usually have the same quality but are in different though complementary elements: Planets in either earth and water or fire and air are in oppositional aspect. The task is to transform the energy so that they strengthen each other and work together rather than work against each other. 
    
    If this happens, the neglected energy is often experienced in the form of projections. The great challenge of the opposition is to integrate the two poles.''')
