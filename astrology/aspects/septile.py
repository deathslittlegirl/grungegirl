    print('''A key word for the septile is "inspiration," be it religious or artistic. The septile indicates a potential to experience the energies of the planets concerned on a deeper spiritual level. For example, a septile between Venus and Jupiter may lead an individual to explore and expand his musical creativity. The energy of the septile is very subtle, and perhaps most people do not experience it in their ordinary lives, except during moments of wonder.''')
