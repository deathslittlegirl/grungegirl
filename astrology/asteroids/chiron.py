def chiron():

    chironInfo = "Chiron is marked by trauma that leads to transformation. The wound that we all suffer greatly from goes deep, and when healed, can become entirely beautiful. To overcome the challenges presented by Chiron, must first overcome their low self-worth. You must also overcome feelings of inadequacy."

    chironThemes = "Themes: Shooting yourself in the foot, achilles heel, damaging ourselves similarly to Neptune and the 12th house more psychologically, and how we nurse a wound. Over-compensation to make up for a weakness."
