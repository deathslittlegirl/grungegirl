    print('''The ascending or north node/Rahu stands for the future or direction in which the person or situation should develop. This direction may be similar to the rest of the chart, or it may suggest new and unfamiliar territory.

The themes symbolised by the north node may appear to be a shining ideal which, however, requires great effort to achieve. With increasing age the individual usually becomes more aware of the calling to reach this goal, particularly between the ages of 18 1/2 and 37 when the transiting moon's nodes return to their positions in the natal chart.

The ascending node is sometimes associated with Jupiter, i.e. with opportunities to grow. Another planetary comparison is that the north node equates to the solar principle (the sun).

Planets which are conjunct the ascending moon's node or in harmonious aspect to the nodal axis can help an individual to rise to the challenge represented by the south node and costructively explore those new aspects of life symbolised by it.''')
