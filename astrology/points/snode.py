    print('''The descending or south node is associated with the past, whether in the karmic sense of things brought 
    over from past lives into the present one, or in the sense of the influence of the past in the present life, 
    such as one's inherited traits. The south node may also show an area of life where the person is proficient, 
    but yet where little further growth will occur: the person's "comfort zone." 

The descending node reflects childhood experiences, particularly those present from an early age. Because they are so 
taken for granted, the individual may be tempted to fall back into familiar and at times obsessive behaviour patterns 
when confronted with new challenges. This behaviour may also lead to negative experiences which can leave the child - 
or later adult - with feelings of inadequacy. When this happens the behaviour pattern can have addictive traits while 
offering only apparent but not real security. 

An individual remains largely unconscious of the themes associated with the south node while (ideally) striving to 
achieve the themes associated with the north node. However, this goal can only be reached if a balance is achieved 
between the two poles.''')
