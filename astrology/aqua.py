aquanfo = "Firmly opionated, progressive and assertive, Aquarians are momentous in their progression through society. Manifesting elaborate schemes to maintain or improve the status quo. They struggle with detachedness and strive to stick out from the rest through their naturally enigmatic nature. Most known for being friendly and accepting of multiple types of people. But this can be a facade they wear to appear more palatable. In reality, their opinions on people may be a lot darker than they let on."
aquanfo2 = "The weirdo of the zodiac, who's wackiness is their most endearing and original quality. Avant garde tastes in aesthetics or culture. Empty contrarian nature at times just to appeal. Can excel in the department of technology and social activism. Studies the room closely before deciding whether or not to make friends. Most known for being the off-kilter charmer with many connections in high places. Paradoxical emotional nature. Passer of strong judgment while ignoring their own faults."
