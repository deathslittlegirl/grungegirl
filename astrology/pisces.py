piscesnfo = "Emotional, deep, artistic and much like a trickster. Pisces navigates the dreamy water-like mesh between perception and reality. They can struggle with being manipulative or vengeful. Proficient in the arts and is always working on something abstract that requires further examination. Known for an emotional and deeply feeling nature. Freely weird and proud of it."
piscesnfo2 = "Also known for being extremely compassionate, Pisces never likes to feel unimportant or unrewarded for their efforts. While they may act selflessly, they know exactly who to give to and who not to. The blinded lover who reveals all for someone who gives none in return. Extraneously gullible but catches on to jokes easily. Reflects the teachings of their environment to a tee, so as to not make mistakes."
