libranfo = "The only inanimate object in the zodiac. Pure balance. Heavy focus on aesthetics, love and beauty. Highest vibration of Venus. While Aries is the ego, Libra is more collective-minded. They can be quite histrionic at times, sacrificing their tastes to be liked by others. Proficient in design-related careers."
libranfo2 = "Highly charming and most known for it. Can suffice as a leader of business initiatives, but will be very selective about staffing. Justice. At their worst, they overcompensate to keep the peace. Sexual and liberated. Confused and anxious."
