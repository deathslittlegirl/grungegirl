dexinfo = "Dextromethorphan (also known as robo, dex, DM, and DXM) is a dissociative substance of the morphinan class. DXM is the primary active ingredient in many common over-the-counter (OTC) cold and cough medicines. When exceeding approved doses, DXM produces dissociative effects similar to those of ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP). The pharmacology of DXM is not completely understood, but it is thought to act primarily by blocking NMDA receptors in the brain."

dexinfo2 = "DXM was first reported in 1953 and approved for use as a cough suppressant in the United States in 1958. After its approval, it was introduced as an OTC medication under the name Romilar. As early as 1975, the popularity and extensive abuse of DXM was recognized, and Romilar was voluntarily removed from the OTC market. A few years later, companies began introducing various refined DXM products designed to deter abuse, such as including ingredients with an unpleasant taste. However, recreational use of DXM has persisted and is a considered a growing trend, particularly among teenagers seeking low cost and easily available highs."

dexfx = "Subjective effects include dissociation, time distortion, bodily hallucinations, immersion enhancement, motor control loss, euphoria, and ego loss. Users commonly describe low doses as producing an alcohol-like intoxication while higher doses produce effects similar to ketamine or PCP. It is often reported to produce a strong, uncomfortable body load with significant nausea. The effects and tolerability of DXM are highly variable between users which may be due to individual differences in the genes underlying metabolism. As a result, many users find the experience of DXM to be either unpleasant, neutral, or dull, while others report mystical-like psychedelic experiences."
