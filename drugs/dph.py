dphinfo = "Diphenhydramine (also known as DPH, Dimedrol, Benadryl, and many others) is a deliriant substance of the ethanolamine class. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine that is widely used as a generic, over-the-counter medication to treat allergies. When exceeding approved doses, diphenhydramine produces powerful deliriant effects. "
dphinfo2 = "Diphenhydramine was first synthesized in 1943. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It was approved for over-the-counter use in the 1980s. Today, it is typically used to treat allergies, but it may also be used for a number of conditions including itchiness, insomnia, motion sickness, nausea and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease."

dphfx = "According to user reports, diphenhydramine displays a non-linear dose-response, meaning the effects don't correspond directly with the dose. Doses under 300 mg are reported to produce restlessness, muscle relaxation, and a body high while doses above 500 mg begin to produce a state of delirium in which the user sees and hears fully-formed, extremely convincing hallucinations. Doses in between these two extremes are said to be uncomfortable and dysphoric. Nausea and bodily discomfort ('body load') is reported almost universally."
