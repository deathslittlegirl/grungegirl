heroinnfo = """Diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate (also known as heroin and colloquially as H, dope, smack, junk, brown, boy, and others) is a semi-synthetic opioid substance of the morphinan class. It is a derivative of morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). Heroin is known for its highly addictive properties and it makes up a large portion of the illicit traffic in narcotics.

Heroin was first synthesized from morphine by a British chemist in 1874 and was introduced as a commercial product by the Bayer Company of Germany in 1898. Although the name heroin is a trade name, it has since been widely adopted for all intents and purposes and may describe a recreational depressant that may or may not contain pure diacetylmorphine.
