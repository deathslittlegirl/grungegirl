hydronfo = """Hydrocodone (commonly sold as Vicodin when combined with paracetamol) is a semi-synthetic opioid morphinan synthesized from codeine, one of the opioid alkaloids found in the opium poppy. It is a narcotic analgesic used orally as a cough suppressant, but also commonly taken orally for relief of moderate to severe pain. Those who take hydrocodone for recreational purposes report a sense of relaxation and euphoria, especially at higher doses.

Hydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States, with the International Narcotics Control Board reporting that 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States. Like many opioids, such as dextropropoxyphene, hydrocodone is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol) to enhance analgesia and deter abuse. Acetaminophen overdoses and long-term use, often due to recreational use, can cause serious or fatal liver damage. Currently, the only brand of hydrocodone in the United States that does not have acetaminophen is Zohydro ER which comes in doses of up to 50mg. """
