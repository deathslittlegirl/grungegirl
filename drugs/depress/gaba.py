gabanfo = """Gabapentin (also known as Neurontin) is a depressant substance of the gabapentinoid class. It is a structural analog of the neurotransmitter GABA and acts by inhibiting certain calcium channels in the brain namely α2δ subunit-containing voltage-dependent calcium channels (VGCCs). Gabapentin was originally developed to treat epilepsy and is currently FDA approved to treat postherpetic neuralgia in adults and as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures. 

It is often prescribed off-label for restless leg syndrome, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. However Gabapentin's efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders is unclear as the evidence is 'somewhat mixed'."""

gabafx = " Subjective effects include mild to moderate anxiety suppression, pain relief, and muscle relaxation. Its analgesic and anxiolytic effects provide gabapentin with some recreational potential in a manner that can be compared to a mild benzodiazepine. However, these recreational effects diminish very quickly with repeated usage and are most commonly reported by those who do not have a tolerance to this compound."
