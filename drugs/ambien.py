ambiinfo = "Zolpidem (also known as Ambien, Intermezzo, Edluar, Stilnoct, Stilnox, Zolpimist, and others) is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine chemical class which is primarily used in the treatment of insomnia. When taken at recreational doses, it reportedly produces powerful and notoriously bizarre atypical hallucinogenic, dissociative, deliriant and even psychedelic effects."

ambiinfo2 = "Zolpidem is a member of a family colloquially known as a 'Z-drug.' Other Z-drugs include zaleplon (Sonata) and zopiclone (Imovane). These drugs were initially thought to be less addictive and/or habit-forming than benzodiazepines. However, this evaluation has shifted in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have accumulated."

ambifx = "FX: It contains many of the physical and cognitive effects of benzodiazepines with a moderately dissociated headspace most similar to that of DXM. This occurs alongside bizarre thought patterns and external hallucinations similar to those of deliriants and visual distortions most similar to those of psychedelics. Overall, this makes zolpidem an extremely unique and unpredictable hallucinogen which requires a trip sitter. "
