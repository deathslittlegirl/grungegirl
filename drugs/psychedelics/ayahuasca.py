Ayanfo = """Ayahuasca (pronounced /eye-uh-WAHS-kuh/ and also known as Yag√©) is an umbrella term that refers to a wide variety of traditional and modern brews and infusions of natural plant sources that produce powerful psychoactive or hallucinogenic effects. Of these, it most commonly consists of a DMT-containing plant source in combination with one that contains an MAOI or RIMA (typically sources like B. caapi vine or syrian rue) to produce uniquely potent, sometimes medicinal, psychedelic effects.

The co-consumption of an MAOI agent is necessary for the combination to work, as the DMT molecule (which is a monoamine closely related to serotonin) is rendered almost entirely inactive when digested by itself due to the presence of monoamine oxidase enzymes in the stomach, which rapidly degrades it. Ayahuasca is used as a traditional spiritual medicine in ceremonies among the Indigenous peoples of Amazonian Peru, many of whom say that they received the instructions in its use directly from the plants and plant spirits themselves. Ayahuasca was first described outside of Indigenous communities in the early 1950s by Harvard ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes, who became aware of the Native communities who use it for divinatory and healing purposes.

Ayafx = "Subjective effects regarding Ayahuasca range from stimulation, sedation, nausea, and changes felt in physical form, to loss of motor function, nausea, after images, colour enhancement, magnification, machinescapes, etc. One person describes the feeling as though you were becoming God. Another says that it is the only way to experience true unity. You also will feel euphoria. Able to perceive time in multiple directions. Heightened creativity. Way fucking more."
