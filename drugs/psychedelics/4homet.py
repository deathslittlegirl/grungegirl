hometnfo = """4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine (also known as "schleeb", "colour", "methylcybin", "metocin", and 4-HO-MET) is a lesser-known novel psychedelic substance of the tryptamine class. 4-HO-MET is chemically related to psilocin, the active ingredient in psilocybin mushrooms ("magic mushrooms"). Like other substituted tryptamines, it produces its psychedelic effects by acting on serotonin receptors in the brain.


4-HO-MET was first synthesized by the American chemist Alexander Shulgin, who documented it in his 1997 book TiHKAL ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). Reports of human use began to surface in the late 2000s following its appearance on the online research chemicals market. It has been sold alongside other psilocybin analogues such as 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT. """

hometfx = "Subjective effects include geometric visual hallucinations, time distortion, enhanced introspection, and ego loss. Users typically describe 4-HO-MET as a more recreational version of psilocybin mushrooms or psilocin (4-HO-DMT) due to its less serious headspace and greater emphasis on visual effects."
