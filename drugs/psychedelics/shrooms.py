shroomnfo = "Psilocybin mushrooms (also known as magic mushrooms, psychedelic mushrooms, and shrooms) are a family of psychoactive mushrooms that contain psilocybin, a psychedelic substance of the tryptamine class. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents and have been taxonomically classified into over 200 species, the most potent of which belong to the genus Psilocybe. Psilocybin mushrooms produce their effects by acting on serotonin receptors in the brain; however, the precise mechanism is not known."
shroomnfo2 = "Psilocybin mushrooms are thought to have been used by various human cultures since before recorded history, based on imagery found on prehistoric rock art. In Mesoamerica, they have been consumed in ritual ceremonies for 3000 years. Following its introduction to American society in 1955 by Gordon R. Wasson, psilocybin was subject to experimental research of mental disorders and in psychotherapy throughout the 1960s. Popularization by 1960s counterculture figures like Timothy Leary led to an explosion of recreational use and resulted in its prohibition in 1970. Today, psilocybin mushrooms are one of the most widely used psychedelics and the subject of renewed interest by researchers and clinicians in the treatment of depression and other disorders."

shroomfx = "Subjective effects include open and closed-eye visuals, time distortion, enhanced introspection, conceptual thinking, euphoria, and ego loss. Notably, the intensity and duration of effects produced by psilocybin mushrooms can vary greatly depending on factors such as species and batch, which can complicate standardized dosing information (see this section). Psilocybin mushrooms are commonly described by users to evoke entheogenic and mystical-type or transpersonal experiences that can facilitate introspection and personal growth."
