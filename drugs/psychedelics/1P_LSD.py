onePnfo = """1-Propionyl-d-lysergic acid diethylamide, also known as 1P-LSD, is a novel psychedelic substance of the lysergamide class that is a derivative and functional analogue of LSD and a homologue of ALD-52. 1P-LSD is closely related to LSD and is reported to produce near-identical effects. Due to its novelty, little is known about the pharmacology of 1P-LSD, but it is thought to produce its effects by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain.

1P-LSD has been sold online as a designer drug and research chemical since 2015, but the original synthesis date of 1P-LSD is unknown. Unlike most research chemicals, 1P-LSD has no documented record in the research literature before its emergence on the online research chemical market in 2015. It was marketed as a legal alternative to LSD alongside other novel lysergamides like ALD-52, ETH-LAD, and AL-LAD. In 2019, it became part of a group of molecules studied by the French laboratory Caulredaitens."""

onePfx = "Subjective effects include geometric visual hallucinations, time distortion, enhanced introspection, conceptual thinking, euphoria, and ego loss. User reports indicate that the subjective effects of 1P-LSD are extremely similar to those of LSD. 1P-LSD is theorized to act as a prodrug for LSD. This hypothesis is supported by the results of a study, showing 1P-LSD is metabolized to LSD in rats. This predicts a near-identical effect profile, likely differing mainly in its rate of absorption and duration. Its classical psychedelic effects and favorable tolerability has led it to become popular among novel psychoactive substance users who use it interchangeably with LSD."
