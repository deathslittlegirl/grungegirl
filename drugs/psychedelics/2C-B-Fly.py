flynfo = """2C-B-FLY is a lesser-known novel psychedelic substance of the phenethylamine and benzodihydrodifuran classes that produces an array of psychedelic and entactogenic effects when administered. Reports have characterized its effects profile as possessing features of 2C-B, mescaline and MDA, with a duration of 6â€“8 hours (or up to 12 hours in larger doses).

2C-B-FLY is a derivative of the 2C-x family of psychedelic phenethylamines, specifically 2C-B, of which it significantly differs from in terms of its potency, metabolism, and potential toxicity. It was first synthesized by Aaron P. Monte in 1996. Around 2005, 2C-B-FLY appeared and gained some popularity in the online research chemicals market before largely disappearing in October 2009, when a batch of Bromo-DragonFLY was accidentally mislabeled as 2C-B-FLY (Bromo-DragonFLY is dosed in micrograms, where 2C-B-FLY is dosed in milligrams) led to two deaths as a result of taking overdoses of Bromo-DragonFLY meant to be effective doses for 2C-B-FLY.
 
 This event led to its immediate withdrawal until around 2016, when it resurfaced on the market again."""

flyfx = "This compound presents a significantly more pronounced body high/load, stronger visual effects, more complex geometry and more in-depth internal hallucinations which are comparable to mescaline, 2C-E or MDA at higher doses. Lower doses, however, are associated with more entactogenic as opposed to classical psychedelic effects."
