weednfo = "Cannabis (also known as marijuana, weed, pot, grass, herb, and many others) is a preparation of the cannabis plant that produces psychoactive effects when consumed (via smoking, vaporizing, or ingestion). The principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which makes up one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabigerol (CBG). At least three species are recognized: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis."

weedfx = "Subjective effects include sedation, appetite enhancement, immersion enhancement, creativity enhancement, increased sense of humor, increased music appreciation, and euphoria. The effects of cannabis can vary widely depending on dose, strain & form, preexisting tolerance, and set and setting. Notably, it can either strongly suppress or enhance anxiety depending on the individual. Higher doses are reported to produce mild-to-moderate hallucinogenic effects such as visual hallucinations, conceptual thinking and time distortion as well as a greater risk of anxiety, paranoia, and delusions (generally more prevalent with sativa strains)."
