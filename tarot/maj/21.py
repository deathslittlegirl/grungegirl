worldinfo = """The World card in the tarot deck has a dancing figure at the center. The dancing figure on the card 
has one leg crossed over the other and holds a wand in either hand. She symbolizes balance and evolution in movement. 
The fulfillment and unity that she represents is not one that is static, but ever-changing, dynamic and eternal. The 
green wreath of flowers that surrounds the central figure is a symbol of success, while the red ribbons that wrap 
around it are reminiscent of infinity. There are four figures on each corner of the card - and they are the same ones 
that are in the Wheel of Fortune. The four figures represent Scorpio, Leo, Aquarius and Taurus - representative of 
the four corners of the universe, the four elements, and the four evangelicals. Together, they symbolize the harmony 
between all of their energies."""

worldup = """Upright: completion, achievement, fulfilment, sense of belonging, wholeness, harmony."""
worlddown = """Downwards: lack of closure, lack of achievement, feeling incomplete, emptiness."""
