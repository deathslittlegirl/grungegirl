suninfo = """The Sun card presents an feeling of optimism and fulfillment. This card represents the dawn which 
follows the darkest of nights. The Sun is the source of all the life on our planet, and it represents life energy 
itself. There is a child depicted in the card, playing joyfully in the foreground. A symbol of our innocence, 
it represents the happiness that occurs when you are in alignment with your true self. The child is naked, 
meaning that he has absolutely nothing to hide. The card also depicts the childhood innocence and absolute purity. 
This is particularly emphasized through the white horse upon which the child is riding. The horse here is also a 
symbol of strength and nobility."""
