deathinfo = """Here, we see Death riding a beautiful white horse while holding up a black flag with a white pattern. 
It is portrayed as a living skeleton, the bones being the only part of the human body existing after death. He wears 
armor, which gives him his invincibility - signaling that no one can destroy Death. The white horse that he rides 
stands for purity, as Death purifies everyone. Beneath him, all classes of humans lie in the dirt - a king, 
and a pauper, meant to remind us that death does not differentiate between class, race, gender."""

deathdown = """Downwards: fear of change, repeating negative patterns, resisting change, stagnancy, decay."""
