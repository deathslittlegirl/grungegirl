temperinfo = """On the Temperance card, there is an angel with wings, whose gender is not immediately obvious, 
which suggests that there is a balance between the sexes. One foot of the angel is in water, to represent the 
subconscious, while the other foot is on dry land, a representation of the material world. On her robe, there is a 
square, which has a triangle inscribed inside, another echo of the tangible earth in union with the holy trinity. She 
holds two cups in a manner where she can mix the waters, which represent the super and subconscious minds. The water 
flows between them, suggesting union and infinity."""
