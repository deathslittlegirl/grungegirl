justinfo = """The Justice tarot card is a symbol of truth, fairness, and law. As she sits in her chair, the scales 
in her left hand represent how intuition should balance logic. She symbolizes impartiality with the double-edged 
sword in her right hand. The clarity in thought which is required to dispense justice are symbolized by the square on 
the crown she wears. Behind her, there is a purple cloak and standing grey pillars. Beneath her red cloak, 
which is held together by a clasp, she shows the tip of a white shoe. This is a spiritual reminder that what she 
delivers are the outcomes of their actions. """
