in many mythologies. The image in the Judgement card shows women, men, and children who are rising from the grave to 
respond to Gabrielâ€™s trumpet call. Their outstretched arms symbolize that they are ready to be judged by the 
universe. They are about to meet their creator, their actions weighed, and find out where they will spend the 
remainder of eternity: in heaven or in hell. The massive tidal wave in the background signify that judgement is 
unavoidable, and that this judgement will be final."""
