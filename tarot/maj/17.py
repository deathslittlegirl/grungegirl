water. One container pours the water out to the dry land, as if to to nourish it and ensure its fertility. The lush 
green land around her seems to say that it is working. One foot is inside the water which shows the spiritual 
abilities and inner strength of the woman. The other foot on the ground shows her practical abilities and strengths. 
Behind her, there is a large central star surrounded by seven small stars which represent the chakras. There is bird 
standing at a tree branch which represents the holy ibis of thought. The Star's astrological correspondent is 
Aquarius. """
