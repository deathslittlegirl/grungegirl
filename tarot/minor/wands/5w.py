wandfiveinfo = '''The Five of Wands depicts five men all holding their own wands and brandishing them up in the air. Like with most fives in the tarot, it is about some kind of disagreement that is facing the querent. This disagreement can either be taken to be as a sign of conflict between the men, or that all of them are simply enjoying the adrenaline rush of this conflict, and that the competition amongst them is of a good natured rivalry, not anger. The relaxed way in which they seem to be holding their wands gives a sense that this argument may be one of show rather than a fierce one.'''

wandfivetheme = '''Themes: brewing conflict, volcanic drama, problems with communication, no one is listening, lack of patience and understanding.'''

wandfiveup = '''Upright: conflict, competition, arguments, aggression, tension, rivals, clashes of ego.'''
wandfivedown = '''Downwards: end of conflict, cooperation, agreements, truces, harmony, peace, avoiding conflict. calm the fuck down'''
