wandqueeninfo = '''The image depicted in the Queen of Wand shows a queen sitting proudly on a throne while facing forwards which is a clear symbol of strength and fire. She is holding a sunflower in her left hand, and the image of the sunflowers are also carved on the throne - meaning happiness, satisfaction, and fertility. In her right hand, she is holding her wand which is starting to blossom, and symbolizes life. In her positive aspects, the Queen of Wands can be associated with fidelity, sustenance, and warmth. Her hidden side is hinted at with the placement of the black cat at her feet, which is traditionally a symbol of witchcraft and occultism, but can also point at her ability to grasp with her deep intuition.'''
