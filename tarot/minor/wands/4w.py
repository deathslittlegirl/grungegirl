wandfourinfo = '''The Four of Wands depicts a couple which dances beneath the welcome wreath which is tied between four wands, which are crystal tipped. There is a canopy of flowers on the card which resembles the canopy that is particularly characteristic of the traditional Jewish ceremony. There seems to be a party that is going on, or some kind of welcome committee for the couple in question. You can see from the image that it represents a time which is sprinkled with feelings of fulfillment, satisfaction brought by the actual attainment of a goal.'''
