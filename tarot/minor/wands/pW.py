wandpageinfo = '''A well-dressed young man is boldly holding a stick standing on a barren land. His shirt is made in a salamander like pattern which is a symbol of transformation from bad to good. This young man is a passionate advocator, who is constantly spreading spiritual and social advancement ideas that lift up his fellow man. The desert in the background behind him both is indicative of his element, fire, and also represents that he is living in a world that has not bared fruit yet. His ideas are therefore completely hypothetical. However, if he were to choose to use them, and undertake the journey of his suit, his purity of heart could lead him to find better fortunes.'''
