wandeightinfo = '''The Eight of Wands is depicted as eight flying staves that appear as if they are suspended in the air. Some may look at them as wands that are blossoming that are traveling at a maximum speed. The background where they travel through is a clear sky which represents that there is likely nothing that will stand in the way of these making it to their destination. It shows a majestic landscape with a river that is streaming, the water breathing life to the image. The wands also appear like they are about to land, which signals the end of a long journey.'''

wandeighttheme = '''Themes: sudden growth, a message to apply yourself to your work, necessary patience, trailblazing energy surrounds you. Full speed ahead.'''
