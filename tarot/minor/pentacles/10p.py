pentateninfo = '''In the Ten of Pentacles card, there is an old man seated in an archway leading into a great estate. It seems he is the head of the family, for he is surrounded by younger loved ones. He wears a robe that is decorated with moon crescents and grapevines - indicating the joining of spirit and matter. He has his family and dogs with him. There is a happy couple in front of him, presumably his children and a playful child behind this couple, his grandchild. The child playfully reaches out to pet the dog.'''
