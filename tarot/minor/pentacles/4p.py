pentafourinfo = '''This card depicts a man who is sitting on a stool, who is holding onto two pentacles in a very defensive and tight posture. Itâ€™s almost as if he is hoarding them out of fear of loss. One pentacle is balanced precariously on his head, while another one is tightly clutched between his own hands, and there are two of them which are securely placed underneath his feet. He is making sure that there is absolutely no one touching his coins. At the same time, he is also unable to move because he is holding the coins so tightly. In other words, he is restrained from acting because he is holding too tight to his possessions. To some, money does not always bring freedom.'''

pentafourtheme = '''Themes: clinginess, stubbornness, selfishness, a stickler.'''

pentafourup = '''Upright: possessiveness, insecurity, hoarding, stinginess, stability, security, savings, materialism, wealth, frugality, boundaries, guardedness.'''
pentafourdown = '''Downwards: generosity, giving, spending, openness, financial insecurity, reckless spending.'''
