pentaseveninfo = '''The Seven of Pentacles shows a young man who seems to be taking a break from his hard labor to admire the fruit and blossoms in his garden. He rests on his shovel as he is admiring the seven pentacles hanging from the lush green vegetation. The way that he is laying his head over hands seems to suggest a kind of fatigue - he has worked hard to make sure that this year's crop is a good one. Because he is focused on long term goals, he cannot touch his harvest right now, and only reserves one of the pentacles for himself, choosing to invest the others. With his efforts, he hopes to grow his crop for the long term.'''

pentasevenup = '''Upright: harvest, rewards, results, growth, progress, perseverance, patience, planning.'''
pentasevendown = '''Downwards: unfinished work, procrastination, low effort, waste, lack of growth, setbacks, impatience, lack of reward.'''
