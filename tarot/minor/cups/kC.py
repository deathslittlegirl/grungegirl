cupkinginfo = '''The King of Cups is a card in the tarot that shows generosity, control, and emotional balance. The card itself depicts a king seated on a throne, who has an amulet that is shaped like a fish. The fish in his necklace represents his creativity and spirit, which thrives on the calm waters that surround him. We can see from the background that there is a steady balance between the conscious and unconscious.

Behind the king, there is a fish jumping out of the ocean on the right side, and a ship on the left side, representative of the emotional and material worlds respectively. The King of Cups shows that you do not suppress your impulses, but have learned to deal with them in a balanced manner.'''

cupkingtheme = '''Themes: dangers of unchecked impulsivity, highly creative or spiritual, balance between subconscience and active conscience, emotional balance, generosity, self-control.'''

cupkingup = '''Upright: wise, diplomatic, balance between head and heart, devoted, advisor, counsellor.'''
cupkingdown = '''Downwards: overwhelmed, anxious, cold, repressed, withdrawn, manipulative, selfish.'''
