cuppageinfo = '''The Page of Cups represents the unexpected inspiration that comes to us from the unconscious, perhaps in ways that we may not truly understand. In this card, a youth at the seashore wears a blue tunic adorned with floral prints, and holds a golden cup. She also wears a beret that looks quite bohemian, and a long flowing scarf. She is surprised by a fish that pops out of the cup, as if to greet her from a fairytale. She can neither drink nor toast with the cup as the fish stares at her and seemingly tries to engage with her.'''

cuppagetheme = '''Themes: unexpected inspiration, deriving inspiration from the unconscious, mindlessly exploring the depths of your mind, The Fool-like approach to creativity. this one's a weird one tbh'''

cuppageup = '''Upright: idealism, sensitivity, dreamer, naivete, innocence, inner child, head in the clouds.'''
cuppagedown = '''Downwards: emotional vulnerability, immaturity, neglecting inner child, escapism, insecurity.'''
