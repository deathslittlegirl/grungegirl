cupknightinfo = '''The Knight of Cups is a card which depicts a young knight who is gloriously riding a white horse while at the same time holding a cup as if he is a messenger of a certain sort. Unlike the Knight of Wands or the Knight of Swords, this particular one isnâ€™t charging along with his horse. He is instead moving slowly forward which provides the entire setting an overall impression of peace and calmness. The horse is known to represent one's drive, energy, and power. The horse's color is white, which is a well-known symbol of spirituality, light, and purity.'''

cupknighttheme = '''Themes: drive/energy, spirituality, tranquility, balance, slow progression, the white horse.'''

cupknightup = '''Upright: idealist, charming, artistic, graceful, tactful, diplomatic, mediator, negotiator.'''
cupknightdown = '''Downwards: disappointment, tantrums, moodiness, turmoil, avoiding conflict, vanity.'''
