cupqueeninfo = '''The Queen of Cups rules the emotional realm. She is the woman whose throne is right on the oceanâ€™s edge, and water is typically symbolic of the unconscious and feeling. Her position at the shore indicates that she lies between land and sea, the place where feeling and thought exist. She holds a cup that has handles shaped like an angel. This cup is closed, which is why the Queen of Cups symbolizes the thoughts that come with our unconscious mind. The queen sits alone, which allows her to think. The calmness of the water and the sky symbolizes the serene mind of the queen. Her feet are not touching the water, which stands for her looking at her thoughts and feelings from the outside.'''

cupqueentheme = '''Themes: more subconscious exploration, outsider perspective of oneself, isolation in order to ruminate, angelic energy.'''

cupqueendown = '''Downwards: insecurity, giving too much, overly-sensitive, needy, fragile, dependence, martyrdom.'''
