cupteninfo = '''On the Ten of Cups, there is a couple holding each other while facing a beautiful house and a green garden. Beside them, there are two children playing joyously. The couple is seen holding each other in a loving and romantic embrace, while the children are freely playing. The couple seems to be in a stable relationship, while also blessed with the abundance of a comfortable home and beautiful children. The green land signifies fertility, and the river shows how freely the feelings of the couple are flowing, meaning that their relationship is quite peaceful. Above in the sky, there are ten cups, shaped in an arc, which are meant to symbolize blessings from heaven. The rainbow behind them shows the end of hard times and sorrows, and a new happy life where each and every one of the family will enjoy. The Ten of Cups card depicts ‘having it all’.'''
