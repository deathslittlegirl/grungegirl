swordnineinfo = '''The Nine of Swords depicts a woman that is sitting on her bed while she holds her head in her hands. It appears as though the woman has just awakened from a very bad nightmare. She seems to be upset, anxious and fearful. Nine swords are hanging on her wall, and a carving that depicts a person defeated by another can be found in her bed. The quilt has been decorated with various astrological symbols and roses. Here we see the same woman in that we saw earlier in the Eight of Swords - and perhaps, she was finally released, but haunted by the nightmares of the suffering she endured while she was left and deserted.'''

swordninetheme = '''Themes: haunted by nightmares, embarassment, uncertainty, paranoia, confusion.'''

swordnineup = '''Upright: fear, anxiety, negativity, breaking point, despair, nightmares, isolation.'''
swordninedown = '''Downwards: recovery, learning to cope, facing life, finding help, shame, guilt, mental health issues.'''
