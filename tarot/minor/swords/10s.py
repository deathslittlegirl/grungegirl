swordteninfo = '''Another one of the most striking and ominous cards in the deck, the Ten of Swords shows a man lying flat on the ground with his face facing the dirt. He is covered with a red cloth from the chest down to his legs. Ten long swords are stabbed into his back, he may not have seen this end coming. There is a terrible stillness in the air: the sky above him is black and cloudy indicating the fear and negativity associated with death. The waters in front of him are still, with no ripples - adding to the eerie stillness and finality of this card. Looking into the horizon, in the east, the sun is rising, and the weather seems very calm despite the darkness. The Ten of Swords seems to intimate that this is the lowest point in one's life, and it cannot get worse than this. At least, even in this state, the sun is rising.'''

swordtentheme = '''Themes: having a bad time, losing at your own game, destruction, collapse, struggle that ends in the worst case scenario with a brighter future ahead.'''

swordtenup = '''Upright: ruin, failure, bitterness, collapse, exhaustion, dead end, victimization, betrayal.'''
swordtendown = '''Downwards: survival, improvement, healing, lessons learned, despair, relapse.'''
