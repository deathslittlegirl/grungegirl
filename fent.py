fentinfo = "Fentanyl (also known as Fentanil and by the brand names Sublimaze, Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis, Instanyl, Abstral, Lazanda among others) is a potent opioid substance of the anilidopiperidine class. It is a strong agonist at the Î¼-opioid receptors and approximately 40 to 50 times more potent than pharmaceutical grade (i.e. 100% pure) heroin and roughly 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine."

fentinfo2 = "A wide range of pharmaceutical fentanyl preparations are available, including transdermal skin patches, lollipops, buccal tablets or patches, nasal sprays, and inhalers. On the street, it is typically encountered in powder form, where it is often cut into or sold as heroin and other drugs, which has resulted in numerous accidental overdoses and fatalities. In 2016, fentanyl and analogues were the most common cause of overdose deaths in the United States at more than 20,000, about half of all opioid-related deaths."

fentfx = "Subjective effects are similar to those of heroin and includes pain relief (analgesia), sedation, respiratory depression, and euphoria. However, it has a rapid onset and short duration of action relative to other opioids, which can lead to compulsive redosing. Additionally, many users report noticeably less euphoria with fentanyl and its analogs. As a result, it is generally considered to have low recreational value. "
