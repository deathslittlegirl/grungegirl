    moonInfo = "The moon represents all things related to innate subconscious thought processes, including emotion. It can also deal with collective emotion as well, since it moves so fast that it counts as a social entity. It governs deeply embedded modus operandi, what makes us secure, the inner mother. Strong placements promote receptivity, responsiveness, reflectiveness. It can drive our personalities quite a bit more than the Sun and Mars."
