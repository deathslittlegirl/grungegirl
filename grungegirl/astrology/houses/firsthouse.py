house1_info = "The house of the Self. The house determines in what fashion we present ourselves to the world. This is how we grow in life. Physical form. The first house is the most important house in astrology. It rules over the way one puts themselves into the world. Saturn here can denote a struggle with feeling like an impostor or just not having enough personality to cut through the mud. Any placements here are exacerbated in terms of their energy and can be used as the wayward point for a reading."
