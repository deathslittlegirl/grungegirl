mooninfo = """When we encounter the Moon, we see a path that leads off into the distance. On either side of the path 
stand a wolf and a dog, representing our animalistic nature - one is civilized, and the other wild and feral. There 
is a crawfish that is crawling out of the pond from which the path stems from. In the distance, we can see two towers 
flanking the central path, once again alluding to the doubles visible in this card. Everything in this card seems to 
echo the other, as if to allude to two possibilities. When we walk down the path, we walk the fine line between 
conscious and unconscious, between the tamed side of civilization of the dog, and the forces of nature represented by 
the wolf."""
