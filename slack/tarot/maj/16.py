towerinfo = """The Tower card depicts a high spire nestled on top of the mountain. A lightning bolt strikes the tower 
which sets it ablaze. Flames are bursting in the windows and people are jumping out of the windows as an act of 
desperation. They perhaps signal the same figures we see chained in the Devil card earlier. They want to escape the 
turmoil and destruction within. The Tower is a symbol for the ambition that is constructed on faulty premises. The 
destruction of the tower must happen in order to clear out the old ways and welcome something new. Its revelations 
can come in a flash of truth or inspiration."""
