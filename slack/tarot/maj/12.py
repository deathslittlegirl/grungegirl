hanginfo = """In this card, it depicts a man who is suspended upside-down, and he is hanging by his foot from the 
living world tree. This tree is rooted deep down in the underworld, and it is known to support the heavens. It is 
believed that the hanging man is actually positioned there by his own free will. We believe this because of the 
serene expression which is on his face. His right foot is bound to the branches, but his left foot remains perfectly 
free. At the same time, he is holding his hands behind his back in a way which forms an inverted triangle. His 
wearing of red pants are a representation of the physical body and humanâ€™s passion, while the blue that he wears in 
his shirt are representative of calm emotions, a color combination that is commonly seen in saints. His intellect is 
symbolized by the yellow color of his shoes, hair and halo."""

hangup = """Upright: sacrifice, waiting, uncertainty, lack of direction, perspective, contemplation."""
hangdown = """Downwards: stalling, disinterest, stagnation, avoiding sacrifice, standstill, apathy."""
