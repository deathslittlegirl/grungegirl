swordeightinfo = '''On the Eight of Swords is a woman who is tied up and blindfolded. There are eight swords placed strategically around her in a way that restricts her movement as though she is in some kind of trap or jail. However, it seems as though whoever built the trap was a little lazy or hasty, leaving some open space where she could escape. But because of the blindfold preventing the woman from seeing, she has no way of finding her way out of this trap. The barren land around her might signify a lack of creativity of some sort, while the grey sky in the background can signify despair, since there she feels that there is no hope of her breaking free from the kind of situation that she is bound to. If only she could take the blindfold off, she would see that she could simply just walk out of this situation.'''

swordeighttheme = '''Themes: two of swords but worse, falling into a mental trap, lacking perspective, lack of creativity.'''

swordeightup = '''Upright: trapped, restricted, victimised, paralysed, helpless, powerless, imprisonment.'''
swordeightdown = '''Downwards: freedom, release, taking control, survivor, facing fears, empowered, surrender.'''
