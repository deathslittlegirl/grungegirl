swordseveninfo = '''In the Seven of Swords card, there is a man that is seen running away sneakily from a camp of some sort, while carrying five swords in his hands. Behind him, two other swords are on standing on the ground. From this image, we can deduce that the Seven of Swords is about stealth, getting away with something, deception or betrayal. 

The expression on the manâ€™s face shows quite a bit of confidence, and he seems to be sure of his success on this mission of stealing the swords. Unfortunately for him though, on the left there seems to be a group of soldiers who have discovered the theft and one soldier is actually raising a flag or a weapon as if to signal his pursuit.'''

swordseventheme = '''Themes: masquerading, sociopathy, using others, trying to get away with something.'''

swordsevenup = '''Upright: lies, trickery, scheming, strategy, resourcefulness, sneakiness, cunning.'''
swordsevendown = '''Downwards: confession, conscience, regret, maliciousness, truth revealed.'''
