swordsixinfo = '''The image in the Six of Swords shows a woman and a child in a boat being rowed in the water to a land that is on the other side. We can gather from the images that the woman and the child are leaving something behind, as their backs are faced towards us. The woman's head is covered with a cloak - perhaps she is fleeing something, and must go without others knowing her true identity. We can assume that because of this, she is undergoing great loss or sadness. The symbolism within the Six of Swords is that of loss or change, as well as moving towards a future that looks more promising than the one that we left behind. The six swords alongside the boat symbolize the strong power of the rational mind, compared to intuition and the heart.'''

swordsixtheme = '''Themes: strong rational mind, suffering from loss, privacy, reclusiveness, fleeing from something yet to be revealed.'''

swordsixup = '''Upright: moving on, departure, leaving behind, distance, accepting lessons.'''
swordsixdown = '''Downwards: stuck in past, returning to trouble, running away from problems, trapped.'''
