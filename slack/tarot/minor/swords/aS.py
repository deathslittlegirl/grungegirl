swordaceinfo = '''The Ace of Swords shows a hand emerging from the clouds wielding a double-edged sword. This double edged sword carries a golden crown while being encircled by a wreath. The wreath has for a long time been associated with victory, success and great achievement.

The crown is used as the symbol for both royalty and the power to rule that comes with royalty.  

Behind the foreground, the sword stands floating over a varied setting - which holds both mountains and sea, which are used as symbols of the vast reach and distant lands that the swords can be used to conquer, as well as ambition.'''

swordaceup = '''Upright: clarity, breakthrough, new idea, concentration, vision, force, focus, truth.'''
swordacedown = '''Downwards: confusion, miscommunication, hostility, arguments, destruction, brutality.'''
