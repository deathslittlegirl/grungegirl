wandseveninfo = '''The Seven of Wands has an image of a man who is standing on a tall hill and being challenged by the opponents below. He seems to be defending this position and attacking in retaliation. It is interesting to note that in the Rider-Waite depiction of the Seven of Wands, the man is wearing not matching shoes. This is linked to the symbolism of being on uneven ground or not having a stable footing in life.'''

wandseventheme = '''Themes: struggles after initial success, competition, maintaining a position, fighting off attackers, tug o' war.'''

wandsevenup = '''Upright: protectiveness, standing up for yourself, defending yourself, protecting territory.'''
wandsevendown = '''Downwards: giving up, admitting defeat, yielding, lack of self belief, surrender.'''
