wandtwoinfo = '''The Two of Wands card features a man standing on top of what looks like a castle and in his right hand he holds a miniature globe. From the way he is standing, the man is looking down upon the vast terrain, in which an ocean lies on the left-hand side, whilst the land stretches over on the right-hand side. The man is wearing an orange tunic and a red hat, symbolizing his enthusiasm towards life itself and hunger for adventure respectively. The miniature globe in his hand represents potential for possible expansion of his reach to broader life experiences.'''

wandtwotheme = '''Themes: similar to AoW, mega plans, good progress, fulfilling a plan, achieving what you set out for.'''

wandtwoup = '''Upright: planning, first steps, making decisions, leaving comfort, taking risks.'''
wandtwodown = '''Downwards: bad planning, over-analyzing, not taking action, playing it safe, avoiding risk.'''
