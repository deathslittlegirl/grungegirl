cupaceinfo = '''In the Ace of Cups card, there is a hand emanating from the clouds holding out a cup, as if in a offer to the querent to take a drink. This cup is overflowing with sparkling water which symbolizes pure and pristine emotion. If you take this offer, drinking from this cup will surely bring you nothing short of emotional as well as spiritual fulfillment. The cup has five streams of water overflowing from the brim. These five streams represent the power of intuition and show the importance of listening to your inner voice. In order to obtain the kind of emotional or spiritual fulfillment that is depicted in the Ace of Cups, the querent will need to follow this inner voice, and remain true to it, regardless of the situation. This will require emotional discipline, but the rewards that this can bring are hinted at within the card itself: overflowing joy and happiness.'''
