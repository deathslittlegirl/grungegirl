cupfourinfo = '''The Four of Cups displays a young man sitting under a tree on a mountaintop, far from others. He seems to be in contemplation and meditation. In front of him are three cups laying on the grass while another cup is being offered to him by a hand in the air. The man has crossed his hand and legs, and he is looking down at the three cups, unimpressed, such that he cannot see the cup being presented to him by the stretched arm.

The Four of Cups represents our tendency to take for granted the things that we have, making it hard for us to see what treasures the universe presents us with. We tend to have the answers to our troubles right around us, but we tend to focus too much on what we do not have.'''

cupfourtheme = '''Themes: taking things for granted, ignoring the possibilities in front of us, blind to the answers to our solutions, ignoring solutions.'''

cupfourup = '''Upright: apathy, contemplation, feeling disconnected, melancholy, boredom, indifference, discontent'''
cupfourdown = '''Downwards: clarity, awareness, acceptance, choosing happiness, depression, negativity.'''
