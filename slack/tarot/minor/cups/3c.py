cupthreeinfo = '''When you draw the Three of Cups, you will see three women lifting their cups up in the air in a celebration of some sort. Good times are in the air, for the three ladies have wreaths made of flowers in their hair. Wreaths are often associated with success and victory, so their happiness is well deserved. The ladies are also seen standing on top of a field of flowers and fruit, further adding to the joyful feelings in this card. There are feelings of beauty, growth, compassion and happiness that the women share between each other. An interesting note though, in the Rider-Waite the woman in the middle is turned away from the reader and her face hidden from view. However, the two other maidens are seen smiling.'''
