pentasixinfo = '''In the image on the Six of Pentacles, there is a man who is dressed in purple robes. The color purple symbolizes is the status and wealth of this man. He has a scale that is balanced in one hand, which stands for equality and fairness. We are reminded of the Justice tarot card, which suggests karma, cause and effect, and that we receive what we give. His other hand is giving money to two beggars who are kneeling at his feet. The Six of Pentacles suggests that you are in a secure enough position to give to others without affecting your own stability.'''
