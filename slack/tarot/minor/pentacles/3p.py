pentathreeinfo = '''The Three of Pentacles displays a young apprentice who works in a cathedral. In front of him, there are two others, a priest and a nobleman of some sort, that are holding plans of the cathedral on a piece of parchment. We can tell from the way the apprentice has raised his head that he is discussing his progress on building the cathedral. The two others are keenly listening to him in order to more clearly understand what is needed of them and how they can provide guidance. Despite the apprentice being less experienced, the two others listen to him because they know his ideas and his experience are fundamental in the successful completion of the whole building. The Three of Pentacles therefore represents the coming together of different kinds of knowledge in order to build something together.'''

pentathreetheme = '''Themes: successful completion, consulting others for guidance, a call for assistance, mentoring others.'''

pentathreeup = '''Upright: teamwork, shared goals, collaboration, apprenticeship, effort, pooling energy.'''
pentathreedown = '''Downwards: lack of cohesion, lack of teamwork, apathy, poor motivation, conflict, ego, competition.'''
