She seems to be part of a wealthy house, for in the far background, we see a castle. A falcon is sitting peacefully and playfully on her left hand. The vines behind her are rich and filled with grapes and golden coins, signaling that she has been very successful in her ventures, which are yielding a great and plentiful harvest.'''
