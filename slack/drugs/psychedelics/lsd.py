lsdinfo = "Lysergic acid diethylamide (also known as Lysergide, LSD-25, LSD, L, Lucy, and Acid) is a classical psychedelic substance of the lysergamide class. It is considered to be the best known, most researched, and culturally influential psychedelic substance. It is thought to produce its psychedelic effects by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood."

lsdinfo2 = "The psychoactive effects of LSD were first discovered in 1943 by Albert Hofmann, a Swiss chemist at Sandoz Laboratories. In the 1950s, it was distributed by Sandoz under the name Delysid and intended for use as an experimental drug in psychotherapy and scientific research. During this period, LSD generated widespread interest from clinicians, researchers, and intellectuals and was notoriously the subject of a secret investigation by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for potential applications in 'mind control'. Recreational LSD use became a central part of the 1960s youth counterculture movement which eventually led to its prohibition in 1971."

lsdfx = "Subjective effects include open and closed-eye visuals, time distortion, enhanced introspection, conceptual thinking, euphoria, and ego loss. LSD is commonly reported to be able to evoke mystical-type experiences that can facilitate self-reflection and personal growth. It is considered by some to be the first modern entheogen, a category which is otherwise limited to traditional plant preparations or extracts."
