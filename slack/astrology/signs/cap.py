capnfo = "Staid, prudent and strategical. Capricorn takes a slow and steady approach to acheiving their dreams. Look to this sign if you want to learn more about conquering obstacles. Watch how they do it and let it become subconscious. Cautious and conservative usually, especially with money. Can come off as cold or boring to others in matters where emotions are needed to navigate. Spiritually symbolizes slow, steady limitations designed to perpetuate a system."
capnfo2 = "Capricorn is the master of deep and unstoppable brooding, surrounded by an air of slow, almost painful melancholy. But with this is also an air of diligence and dedication to a task, because you aren't willing to let the demons catch up to you any time soon. Does not favor mystery or even toy with the concept. Will answer any questions asked with stark honesty."

cap_trip = "Element: Fire"

cap_ruler = "Ruler: Saturn"
cap_qual = "Quality: Fixed"

cap_key = "Keyword: I use"

cap_polar = "Polarity: Cancer. While Cancer is emotionally reserved in relationships, they are still, by design, built in a way that Capricorn does not grasp. Cancer is emotional, family-oriented and dreamy. Capricorn does not share any of these traits, and focuses instead of managing society at large."

cap_body = "Part of Body: Bones, joints and knees."
