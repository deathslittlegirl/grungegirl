    print('''An aspect of 45 degrees between two planets. The semi-square is considered to be a minor aspect and is rarely included in modern or traditional astrological interpretations. It can occur in either two adjacent signs or houses, or in two signs or houses separated by another one in between them. It has an orb of 1 to 2 degrees.
    
The energy of the semi-square is similar to that of the square and sesquisquare, being one of the 2-series of aspects. It is therefore counted as one of the analytical aspects which show tension but also challenges that can help us grow and learn. However, any conflicts felt are not as immediately apparent as they are in the case of the square, making it easier to avoid them and miss an opportunity for growth.
So, a semi-square can indicate subtle tensions which we would rather ignore. This may intially seem tempting but is unlikely to lead to long term solutions. ''')
