    lilithInfo = "The Black Moon Lilith, also sometimes called the dark moon, is the point along the moon's orbit when it's farthest from Earth. Lilith relates to your inner authority, sensuality, and sexuality, as well as how you choose (or don't choose) to go against the grain and defy norms. Your Lilith sign can make you feel exposed or empowered, depending on how confident and self-directed you are. And when uncontrolled, Lilith can also reveal your obsessive or destructive tendencies."

    lilithThemes = "Themes: Sexual liberation, rebellion, abrasive destruction of status quo, strong sexuality, what commands you from the shadows."
