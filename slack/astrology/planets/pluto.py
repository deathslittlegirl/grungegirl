Vindication also thrives under Pluto's dominion. Obsession and abrasive sexuality continually appear here. Death is the common subject, used to make metaphorical the process of our transformation. Dig deep and find the truth. It will scare you and you will embrace it. Pluto is the great revealer and will make your head spin. You can discover a consistent and unrelenting struggle for domination."
